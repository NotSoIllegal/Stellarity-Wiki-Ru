## Obtaining
Tome of jinx can be found in End city treasure chests and End Dungeons

## Usage
Using right click spawns a slow moving pink cloud that grows in size as it travels. The clound lasts for 2 seconds. Enemies caught in the cloud are applied the [Jinx](../../mechanics/status_effects.md#jinx) effect for 10 seconds, lowering defense by 25%

This has a 10 second cooldown

## Tips 
- This is extremely useful support against another player, as other players will have high defense.
