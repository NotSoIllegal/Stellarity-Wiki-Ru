# Nature's Wrath

<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Nature's Wrath** is a post-Dragon spellbook which can either shoot a homing Nature's Spirit with limited range when right clicked or summon a pack of Spirit Wolves when used while sneaking. Both abilities can be upgraded by visiting certain biomes while holding the book.

## Obtaining
Unobtainable becasue end trading doesnt work, but the intended obtainment is that librarians in [End Villages](../../structures/end_village.md) can turn any Enchanted Book into Nature's Wrath for 12 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-oak-sapling"></i>Oak Saplings. However, only half of them sell the Spellbook.

## Usage
### Nature's Spirits
Right-clicking shoots a slow Nature's Spirit, which automatically homes in on nearby enemies, dealing 4:heart::heart: damage. Spirits don't require any ammunition to be fired and they last for 1.5 seconds before disappearing. Spirits cannot home onto players in PvP and cannot damage <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-entity-wolf"></i>Wolves.

Visiting certain biomes **while holding Nature's Wrath in any hand** imbues it with a fraction of the biome's power, enchancing the Spirits and adding new types of Spirits which can be fired. The amount of Spirits different from the default one which Nature's Wrath can fire will from now on be referred to as `amount of Spirit Upgrades`.

| Spirit Type | Color | Biomes | Damage | Armor Penetration | Effects | Notes |
| :--- | :---  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Normal | Light Blue | :x: *(default)* | 4:heart::heart: | 20% | :x: | Damage increased to 5:heart: х ₂.₅ at 5 Spirit Upgrades and 6:heart: х ₃ at 8 Spirit Upgrades |
| Forest | Dark Green | Any forest biome | 5:heart: х ₂.₅ | 20% | Grants 4:yellow_heart::yellow_heart: points of Absorption for 8 seconds | Moves 15% quicker<br>Absorption duration increased at 6 total Spirit Upgrades |
| Fire | Orange | Any Nether biome[^2] | 6:heart: х ₃ | 20% | Sets target on fire for 2 seconds | Fire duration is extented by 5 ticks for every Spirit Upgrade<br>Does not work on players in PvP |
| Jungle | Light Green | Jungle, Bamboo Jungle | 6:heart: х ₃ | 30% | Inflicts Poison I for 11 seconds | At 4 Spirit Upgrades, Poison duration is reduced to 7 seconds, but potency increased to II<br>At 7 Spirit Upgrades, Poison Duration is reduced to 5 seconds, but potency is increased to III<br>Moves 25% quicker |
| Ocean | Pink | Any ocean biome | 5:heart: х ₂.₅ | 20% | Grants Regeneration I for 13 seconds | At 7 Spirit Upgrades, Regeneration duration is reduced to 7 seconds, but potency is increased to II<br>Moves 10% slower<br>Ignores speed penalty in liquids |
| Mountain | Yellow | Any mountain biome | 7:heart: х ₃.₅ | 35% | Gives you 9 seconds of resistance on hit. | Moves 40% quicker.  | 
| Snow | White | Any snowy biome | 5:heart: х ₂.₅ | 20% | Inflicts Slowness I for 6 seconds<br>Has a 66% chance to inflict Frostburn for 2 seconds | Fire duration is extented by 4 ticks for every Spirit Upgrade |
| Swamp | Brown | Swamp, Mangrove Swamp | 6:heart: х ₃ | 20% | Inflicts high knockback | Does not work on players in PvP |
| Sculk | Black | Deep Dark, Sculk Growth | 11:heart: х ₅.₅ | 25% | Deals high splash damage to nearby entities | Moves 20% slower. |
| Hallowed | Blue | The Hallow | 7:heart: х ₃.₅ | 20% | Deals 12:heart::heart::heart::heart::heart::heart: damage to undead mobs<br>Creates a small explosion which doesn't destroy blocks | Moves 10% quicker |

By default there is a 50% chance to shoot a regular Spirit *(33% if above 7 Spirit Upgrades)*. If not, then the other spirits will be shot out in a cycle. However, certain Spirit types have a higher chance to be chosen depending on some circumstances:

- Ocean Spirits are 4x more likely to be chosen if user is underwater.
- Mountain Spirits are 3x more likely to be chosen if there are mobs in a 13 - 23 block radius around the player, **but no mobs in a 13 block radius**.
- Hallowed Spirits are 2x more likely to be chosen if there are more than 3 undead mobs in a 8 block radius around the player.
- Sculk Spirits are 2x more likely to be chosen if there are more than 5 mobs in a 9 block radius around the player.

Spirtis can be fired every 1 second. Each Spirit Upgrade also reduces cooldown at which Nature's Wrath fires by half a tick. Due to rounding of scoreboards in Minecraft, this means that for every 2 Spirit Upgrades, the cooldown will be reduced by 0.05 seconds.

### Spirit Wolves
Sneaking and right-clicking casts an alternate ability, which summons a pack of Spirit Wolves. They act like regular tamed dogs, however they deal more damage, move quicker and have a bit more health. They automatically despawn after 24 seconds.

The number of Spirit Wolves spawned, as well as their stats, is directly tied to the number of Spirit Upgrades. By default, only 2 will spawn, with 3rd one being spawned at 3 Spirit Upgrades, 4th one at 6 and finally 5th one at 9.

| Number of Spirit Upgrades | Health | Damage | Extra Movement Speed | Armor | Armor Toughness | Knockback Resistance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| < 2 | 20 | 4 | 4% | 1 | :x: | :x: |
| 2 - 3 | 20 | 4 | 10% | 2 | :x: | 5% |
| 4 - 6 | 20 | 5 | 16% | 2 | 1 | 10% |
| 7 - 8 | 20 | 5 | 22% | 3 | 1 | 15% |
| 9 | 20 | 6 | 28% | 3 | 2 | 20% |

After Spirit Wolves despawn, there is a 20 seconds cooldown before they can be summoned again.

## Tips 
- This is a neat ranged weapon which on top of plethora of special effects it provides has unlimited ammo.
- Damage of Spirits cannot be boosted by any means, other than Nature's Wrath self-upgrading.

## Trivia
- It is the only spellbook with 2 different abilities.
- It is the only spellbook to not mention its cooldown in the description.
