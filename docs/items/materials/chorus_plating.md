## Obtaining
Chorus Plating can be found inside any Crate fished up via [Void Fishing](../../mechanics/void_fishing.md) or Chests in Dungeons and End Cities.

## Usage
Combining 4 Chorus Plating with a netherite armor piece and 1 [Enderite Smithing Template](enderite_smithing_template.md) over the [Altar of The Accursed](../../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) crafts a piece of Chorus Champion Armor.
