# Slayer Crossbow
<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Slayer Crossbow** is a crossbow that shoots an energy bolt that branches out into other bolts. These bolts infinitely pierce but with limited range.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchantng-table"></i> Slayer Crossbow can be enchanted with any Crossbow enchantment, though multishot does not do anything. Piercing increases Slayer Crossbow's damage instead of pierce.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Slayer Crossbow can be repaired by fusing it with a different <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-crossbow"></i>Crossbow.

## Obtaining
you use /loot because its unobtainable.

## Usage
When shot, an energy bolt that branches out into multiple bolts is shot, dealing 9 :heart::heart::heart::heart::heart: x 1/2 damage, and instantly travels. This bolt has a limited range, but the bolt can infinitely pierce.

Quick charge works normally with Slayer Crossow, but multishot does not work. Piercing is altered to, instead of increasing pierce, increase damage by 2. :heart: This makes a Slayer Crossbow with piercing 4's total damage 17. :heart:x 8.5

## Tips 
- This weapon should be used like a shotgun, due to its low range, but high damage
- This can be a very strong weapon against dense and strong crowds, due to its high damage per second combined with infinite piercing.

## Trivia
- The Description used by the bow in game is actually the [Call of the Void's](../items/call_of_the_void.md). The reverse of this happens too, where the Call of the Void uses Slayer Crossbow's description.

## History
=== "**2.2.0**"
    - Introduced in the files, fully functioning but unobtainable.
