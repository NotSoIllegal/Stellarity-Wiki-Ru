## Obtaining
Frigid Harvester has a 10% chance to be found inside Frozen Crates fished up during [Void Fishing](../mechanics/void_fishing.md).

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-mob-stray-face"></i>Strays found in [Frosted Hills](../biomes/frosted_hills.md) have a 3% chance to spawn holding a Frigid Harvester, which they always drop on death. Strays equipped with Harvesters have increased stats and wear a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond-helmet"></i>Diamond Helmet and <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond-chestplate"></i>Chestplate.

## Usage
Killing any living mob permanently increases Frigid Harvester's damage. Stronger mobs give more extra damage, while passive mobs barely grant any increase. Displayed damage is shown to the hundreth, meaning that e.g. damage value of `8.623` is going to be displayed as `8.62` instead.

The Frigid Harvester has 4 tiers that it can unlock. 
Tier 1 is unlocked at 7 damage. Small bits of pink appear in the center of the blade. The attack speed and movement speed while held decrease to 0.95 and 95%.
Tier 2 is unlocked at 10 damage. More pink appears on the back, center, and tip of the sword. The attack speed and movement speed while held decrease to 0.9 and 90%.
Tier 3 is unlocked at 13 damage. The entire guard and more of the blade itself becomes pink. The attack speed and movement speed while held decrease to 0.8 and 85%.
Tier 4 is unlocked at 16 damage. The guard is replaced by a new one and most the blade itself has turned pink. Once you hit this tier, the Frigid Harvester becomes unbreakable and no longer gains any more damage. The attack speed and movement speed while held decrease to 0.75 and 80%.

### Passive Abilities
The Frigid Harvester can gain passive abilities by killing specific mobs.
<br><i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-mob-blaze-face"></i> Blaze: Frostburn. Extreme cold burns enemies for extra damage.
<br><i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-mob-wither-skeleton-face"></i> Wither Skeleton: Embrittlement. Hit enemies become brittle and take extra frostbite damage from all sources.

## Tips
- Even though Frigid Harvester starts extremely weak compared to other weapons of the same tier, it can quickly outdamage them with enough grinding and right setup.
- You get slowed down while holding a Frigid Harvester. This can be cancelled out by using a Swiftness Potion.
- An enderman farm is a way of getting a Frigid Harvester to the maximum damage.
- Anima Conduit is by far the best item ability in Stellarity in terms of survivability. It could even potentially remove the need to eat completely given the player regularly goes after some mobs to kill.
    - This however comes with a price of long mob grinding to get the Harvester to its maximum potential.
- As you cannot enchant the Frigid Harvester with Sharpness, make sure to get it Smite or Critical Strike.
- Frigid Harvester is one of the 2 upgradable items in Stellarity, the other one being [Nature's Wrath](spellbooks/natures_wrath.md)

## Trivia
- The passive ability Arctic wind is misspelled as artctic wind in game. Along with this, frost barrier's description misspelles temporary as temporar.
- This is the third Developer weapon to get added into Stellarity, the first being [Prismatic Punch](prismatic_punch.md), second being [Spirit Dagger (Now called The Beginning and The End)](the_beginning_and_the_end.md).
- This weapon is based on Aery[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
	- In some places in the code, Frigid Harvester is reffered to as `aery_sword`.
- Lorewise, Frigid Harvester is said to had been made by an unknown Illager.
- Despite 2.0c reducing damage gains from mobs, the change it made to scaling means it was still easier to max out Frigid Harvester than in 2.0b and prior.
- The name of the advancement `Frozen Reaper` used to be `Snow Graved`. That is a reference to one of Noelle's spells[^4] in deltarune Chapter 2.
