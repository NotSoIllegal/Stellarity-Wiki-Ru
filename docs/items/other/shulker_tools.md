## Obtaining
Upgrade a netherite tool with 4 shulker shells and 1 [Enderite Smithing Template](../materials/enderite_smithing_template.md) at the [Altar of the Accursed](../../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md)

## Usage
Holding any of these items will give you haste 1, allowing them to mine their specific blocks, or attack 10% faster. This makes them useful for harvesting materials quickly and easily.

## Tips
- The Shulker Sword is generally not a weapon you need to go out of your way for, it's a great sword on its own, but Stellarity provides you with many more unique options.
	- The tools, on the other hand, are certainly worth it, as they are upgrades that have no alternatives, besides the [Hematic Pickaxe](hematic_pickaxe.md).

## Trivia
- This item only exists as a donor request, Kohy finds items like these very unoriginal.
