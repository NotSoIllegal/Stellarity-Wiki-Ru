## Obtaining
Vindicators in Strongholds have an 8% chance to spawn with it equipped. They will ALWAYS drop it when killed.
Alternatively, it can be bought from the Armorer Villager in the End Villages, like all Stronghold-exclusive drops, but this does not work right now.

## Usage
Every 7 seconds (14 seconds for the last charge), the shield gains a charge. When you sneak, the charge is let out, dealing 4 :heart::heart: damage to any enemy hit, and launching you 7 blocks forward. You can also dash into shulker bullets to zap them away. Creeper hit by the dash have a 25% chance to get charged.

## Tips
- Copper Elektra Shield is a good option for mobility, and its dash can be used to get out of tough situations, or to just travel faster.
- Don't try to use this item for damage, the damage amount from this item is pitiful.
- If you dash right up against a block using the Copper Elektra Shield, you will phase through the block. This could be extremely useful to get out of a bad situation.

## Trivia
- The [Crest of the End](../trinkets/crest_of_the_end.md) used to have a similar mechanic to this, but much jankier.
    - This was then replaced with the current mechanic.
