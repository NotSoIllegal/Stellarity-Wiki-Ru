## Obtaining
The Dragon's Eye has a chance to be dropped by the Ender Dragon

## Usage
When held, Endermen and Phantoms become fully passive, meaning they won't attack even if you attack them. It can also provide immunity to various debuffs, including slowness, weakness, nausea, darkness, blindness, mining fatigue and hunger.

## Tips
- This item is great for making phantoms not a pain and so you can now ignore the horrible decision we all made year ago.
- Mining fatigue immunity makes the Dragon's Eye very convenient for ocean monuments.

## Trivia
- Instead of debuff immunity, the item was at first going to highlight mobs around you.
