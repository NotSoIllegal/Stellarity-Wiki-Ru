## Obtaining
Call of the Void can be crafted at the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) using any bow, 8 Dragon's Breath, 16 [Enderite Shards](../items/materials/enderite_shard.md), and 1 [Enderite Smithing Template](../items/materials/enderite_smithing_template.md).

## Usage
When used, Shoots arrows that travel faster and deal 15% more damage than a normal bow. The arrow shot from the bow shatters upon impact, dealing 4.5 :heart::heart::heart:x 1/4 damage. Enemies that are directly hit by the bow are applied Voided 1, which reduces the effected entity's hp by 20%

## Tips
- This bow is the easiest way to apply the Voided effect to an entity. The only other way is through the [Dragonblade's](../items/dragonblade.md) punch attack.
- The Voided effect make's this a great weapon to use against high hp or highly armored enemies, like a ravager or another player, because of voided being percentage based

## Trivia
- The Description used by the bow in game is actually the [Slayer Crossbow's](../items/slayer_crossbow.md). The reverse of this happens too, where the Slayer crossbow uses Call of the Voids description
