## Obtaining
Prismember has a 33% chance to be dropped by the Empress of Light, but only if killed in The End or in the Overworld during nighttime.

## Usage
When you crouch, a red and orange timer appears above your hotbar. 
After 8 ticks, it is filled up and tells you to attack. 
When you do, a fiery spin is released, dealing 8:heart::heart::heart::heart: damage with 30% armor penetration, 
and applying Prismatic Inferno for 3 seconds, with an extra second for each level of fire aspect you have.
This spin has a 20 tick cooldown.

## Tips
- This weapon is great for hitting and running. Just make sure to reapply Prismatic Inferno every few seconds for it to not timeout.
